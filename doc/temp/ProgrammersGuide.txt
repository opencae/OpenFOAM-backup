ATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (“CCPL” OR “LICENSE”). THE WORK IS PRO-
TECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PRO-
HIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LI-
CENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Deﬁnitions
a. “Adaptation” means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing
works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cine-
matographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or
adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram,
the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (“synching”) will be
considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
b. “Collection” means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and an-
thologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter
other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrange-
ment of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
entirety in unmodiﬁed form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collec-
tive whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
deﬁned above) for the purposes of this License.
c. “Distribute” means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work
through sale or other transfer of ownership.
d. “Licensor” means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that oﬀer(s) the Work under
the terms of this License.
e. “Original Author” means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals,
entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identiﬁed, the
publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians,
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1

dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram
the producer being the person or legal entity who ﬁrst ﬁxes the sounds of a performance
or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the
broadcast.
f. “Work” means the literary and/or artistic work oﬀered under the terms of this License
including without limitation any production in the literary, scientiﬁc and artistic domain,
whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature;
a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb
show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing,
painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are
assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to
the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
g. “You” means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not pre-
viously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received
express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
violation.
h. “Publicly Perform” means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to
the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless
means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or
rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
3. License Grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to ex-
ercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
P-4
b. and, to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modiﬁcations as are technically necessary
to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make
Adaptations. Subject to 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved,
including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).
4. Restrictions.
The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following
restrictions:
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You
must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI) for, this License with every
copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not oﬀer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work
to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any eﬀective
technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from
You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If
You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner
that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital ﬁle-
sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request
has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work
and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
entity, journal) for attribution (“Attribution Parties”) in Licensor’s copyright notice, terms
of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of
the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
speciﬁes to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright
notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection,
at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of Collection
appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
P-5
Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
d. For the avoidance of doubt:
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the
right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot
be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right
to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose
or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and
otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme; and,
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties,
whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is
otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b).
e. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by
applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or
as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory
action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author’s honor or
reputation.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHER-
WISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBIL-
ITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE
OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability.
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LI-
CENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDEN-
TAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach
by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
P-6
from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
reserves the right to release the Work under diﬀerent license terms or to stop distributing
the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw
this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
of this License), and this License will continue in full force and eﬀect unless terminated as
stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor oﬀers
to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
to You under this License.
b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
not aﬀect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with
such waiver or consent.
d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work
licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
the Work not speciﬁed here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
may appear in any communication from You.
e. This License may not be modiﬁed without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor
and You. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were
drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961,
the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of
1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights
and subject matter take eﬀect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License,
such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended
to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
Chapter 1
Tensor mathematics
This Chapter describes tensors and their algebraic operations and how they are represented
in mathematical text in this book. It then explains how tensors and tensor algebra are
programmed in OpenFOAM.
1.1 Coordinate system
OpenFOAM is primarily designed to solve problems in continuum mechanics, i.e. the branch
of mechanics concerned with the stresses in solids, liquids and gases and the deformation
or ﬂow of these materials. OpenFOAM is therefore based in 3 dimensional space and
time and deals with physical entities described by tensors. The coordinate system used by
OpenFOAM is the right-handed rectangular Cartesian axes as shown in Figure 1.1. This
system of axes is constructed by deﬁning an origin O from which three lines are drawn at
right angles to each other, termed the Ox, Oy, Oz axes. A right-handed set of axes is
deﬁned such that to an observer looking down the Oz axis (with O nearest them), the arc
from a point on the Ox axis to a point on the Oy axis is in a clockwise sense.

z
x
Figure 1.1: Right handed axes
1.2 Tensors
The term tensor describes an entity that belongs to a particular space and obeys certain
mathematical rules. Brieﬂy, tensors are represented by a set of component values relating
P-14 Tensor mathematics
to a set of unit base vectors; in OpenFOAM the unit base vectors ix
, iy
and iz
are aligned
with the right-handed rectangular Cartesian axes x, y and z respectively. The base vectors
are therefore orthogonal, i.e. at right-angles to one another. Every tensor has the following
attributes:
Dimension d of the particular space to which they belong, i.e. d = 3 in OpenFOAM;
Rank An integer r ≥ 0, such that the number of component values = dr.
While OpenFOAM 1.x is set to 3 dimensions, it oﬀers tensors of ranks 0 to 3 as standard
while being written in such a way to allow this basic set of ranks to be extended indeﬁnitely.
Tensors of rank 0 and 1, better known as scalars and vectors, should be familiar to readers;
tensors of rank 2 and 3 may not be so familiar. For completeness all ranks of tensor oﬀered
as standard in OpenFOAM 1.x are reviewed below.
Rank 0 ‘scalar’ Any property which can be represented by a single real number, denoted
by characters in italics, e.g. mass m, volume V , pressure p and viscosity µ.
Rank 1 ‘vector’ An entity which can be represented physically by both magnitude and
direction. In component form, the vector a = (a1
, a2
, a3
) relates to a set of Cartesian
axes x, y, z respectively. The index notation presents the same vector as ai
, i = 1, 2, 3,
although the list of indices i = 1, 2, 3 will be omitted in this book, as it is intuitive
since we are always dealing with 3 dimensions.
Rank 2 ‘tensor’ or second rank tensor, T has 9 components which can be expressed in
array notation as:
T = Tij
=


T11
T12
T13
T21
T22
T23
T31
T32
T33

 (1.1)
The components Tij
are now represented using 2 indices since r = 2 and the list of
indices i, j = 1, 2, 3 is omitted as before. The components for which i = j are referred
to as the diagonal components, and those for which i = j are referred to as the oﬀ-
diagonal components. The transpose of T is produced by exchanging components
across the diagonal such that
TT = Tji
=


T11
T21
T31
T12
T22
T32
T13
T23
T33

 (1.2)
Note: a rank 2 tensor is often colloquially termed ‘tensor’ since the occurrence of
higher order tensors is fairly rare.
Symmetric rank 2 The term ‘symmetric’ refers to components being symmetric about the
diagonal, i.e. Tij
= Tji
. In this case, there are only 6 independent components since
T12
= T21
, T13
= T31
and T23
= T32
. OpenFOAM distinguishes between symmetric
and non-symmetric tensors to save memory by storing 6 components rather than 9
if the tensor is symmetric. Most tensors encountered in continuum mechanics are
symmetric.
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
1.2 Tensors P-15
Rank 3 has 27 components and is represented in index notation as Pijk
which is too long
to represent in array notation as in Equation 1.1.
Symmetric rank 3 Symmetry of a rank 3 tensor is deﬁned in OpenFOAM to mean that
Pijk
= Pikj
= Pjik
= Pjki
= Pkij
= Pkji
and therefore has 10 independent components.
More speciﬁcally, it is formed by the outer product of 3 identical vectors, where the
outer product operation is described in Section 1.3.4.
1.2.1 Tensor notation
This is a book on computational continuum mechanics that deals with problems involving
complex PDEs in 3 spatial dimensions and in time. It is vital from the beginning to adopt a
notation for the equations which is compact yet unambiguous. To make the equations easy
to follow, we must use a notation that encapsulates the idea of a tensor as an entity in the
own right, rather than a list of scalar components. Additionally, any tensor operation should
be perceived as an operation on the entire tensor entity rather than a series of operations
on its components.
Consequently, in this book the tensor notation is preferred in which any tensor of rank
1 and above, i.e. all tensors other than scalars, are represented by letters in bold face, e.g.
a. This actively promotes the concept of a tensor as a entity in its own right since it is
denoted by a single symbol, and it is also extremely compact. The potential drawback is
that the rank of a bold face symbol is not immediately apparent, although it is clearly not
zero. However, in practice this presents no real problem since we are aware of the property
each symbol represents and therefore intuitively know its rank, e.g. we know velocity U is
a tensor of rank 1.
A further, more fundamental idea regarding the choice of notation is that the mathemat-
ical representation of a tensor should not change depending on our coordinate system, i.e.
the vector ais the same vector irrespective of where we view it from. The tensor notation
supports this concept as it implies nothing about the coordinate system. However, other
notations, e.g. ai
, expose the individual components of the tensor which naturally implies
the choice of coordinate system. The unsatisfactory consequence of this is that the tensor is
then represented by a set of values which are not unique — they depend on the coordinate
system.
That said, the index notation, introduced in Section 1.2, is adopted from time to time
in this book mainly to expand tensor operations into the constituent components. When
using the index notation, we adopt the summation convention which states that whenever
the same letter subscript occurs twice in a term, the that subscript is to be given all values,
i.e. 1, 2, 3, and the results added together, e.g.
ai
bi
=
3
i=1
ai
bi
= a1
b1
+ a2
b2
+ a3
b3
(1.3)
In the remainder of the book the symbol is omitted since the repeated subscript
indicates the summation.

1.3 Algebraic tensor operations
This section describes all the algebraic operations for tensors that are available in Open-
FOAM. Let us ﬁrst review the most simple tensor operations: addition, subtraction, and
scalar multiplication and division. Addition and subtraction are both commutative and as-
sociative and are only valid between tensors of the same rank. The operations are performed
by addition/subtraction of respective components of the tensors, e.g. the subtraction of two
vectors a and b is
a − b = ai
− bi
= (a1
− b1
, a2
− b2
, a3
− b3
) (1.4)
Multiplication of any tensor a by a scalar s is also commutative and associative and is
performed by multiplying all the tensor components by the scalar. For example,
sa = sai
= (sa1
, sa2
, sa3
) (1.5)
Division between a tensor a and a scalar is only relevant when the scalar is the second
argument of the operation, i.e.
a/s = ai
/s = (a1
/s, a2
/s, a3
/s) (1.6)
Following these operations are a set of more complex products between tensors of rank 1
and above, described in the following Sections.
1.3.1 The inner product
The inner product operates on any two tensors of rank r1
and r2
such that the rank of the
result r = r1
+ r2
− 2. Inner product operations with tensors up to rank 3 are described
below:
• The inner product of two vectors a and b is commutative and produces a scalar
s = a •
b where
s = ai

(1.7)
• The inner product of a tensor T and vector a produces a vector b = T •

This is non-commutative so that a = P •

produces a vector c = a × b whose components are

0 when any two indices are equal
+1 when i,j,k are an even permutation of 1,2,3
−1 when i,j,k are an odd permutation of 1,2,3
(1.23)
in which the even permutations are 123, 231 and 312 and the odd permutations are 132,
213 and 321.
1.3.6 Other general tensor operations
Some less common tensor operations and terminology used by OpenFOAM are described
below.
Square of a tensor is deﬁned as the outer product of the tensor with itself, e.g. for a vector
a, the square a2 = aa.
nth power of a tensor is evaluated by n outer products of the tensor, e.g. for a vector a,
the 3rd power a3 = aaa.
Magnitude squared of a tensor is the rth inner product of the tensor of rank r with itself,
to produce a scalar. For example, for a second rank tensor T, |T|2 = T •
•
T.
Magnitude is the square root of the magnitude squared, e.g. for a tensor T, |T| =
√
T •
•
T.
Vectors of unit magnitude are referred to as unit vectors.
Component maximum is the component of the tensor with greatest value, inclusive of
sign, i.e. not the largest magnitude.
Component minimum is the component of the tensor with smallest value.
Component average is the mean of all components of a tensor.
Scale As the name suggests, the scale function is a tool for scaling the components of one
tensor by the components of another tensor of the same rank. It is evaluated as the
product of corresponding components of 2 tensors, e.g., scaling vector a by vector b
would produce vector c whose components are
ci
= scale(a, b) = (a1
b1
, a2
b2
, a3
b3
) (1.24)

1.3 Algebraic tensor operations P-19
1.3.7 Geometric transformation and the identity tensor
A second rank tensor T is strictly deﬁned as a linear vector function, i.e. it is a function
which associates an argument vector a to another vector b by the inner product b = T •
a.
The components of T can be chosen to perform a speciﬁc geometric transformation of a
tensor from the x, y, z coordinate system to a new coordinate system x∗, y∗, z∗; T is
then referred to as the transformation tensor. While a scalar remains unchanged under a
transformation, the vector a is transformed to a∗ by
a∗ = T •
a (1.25)
A second rank tensor S is transformed to S∗ according to
S∗ = T •
S •
TT (1.26)
The identity tensor I is deﬁned by the requirement that it transforms another tensor
onto itself. For all vectors a
a = I •
a (1.27)
and therefore
I = δij
=


1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1

 (1.28)
where δij
is known as the Kronecker delta symbol.
1.3.8 Useful tensor identities
Several identities are listed below which can be veriﬁed by under the assumption that all
the relevant derivatives exist and are continuous. The identities are expressed for scalar s
and vector a.
∇ •
(∇ × a) ≡ 0
∇ × (∇s) ≡ 0
∇ •
(sa) ≡ s∇ •
a + a •
∇s
∇ × (sa) ≡ s∇ × a + ∇s × a
∇(a •

(a × b) ≡ b •

1.3.9 Operations exclusive to tensors of rank 2
There are several operations that manipulate the components of tensors of rank 2 that are
listed below:
Transpose of a tensor T = Tij
is TT = Tji
as described in Equation 1.2.
Symmetric and skew (antisymmetric) tensors As discussed in section 1.2, a tensor is
said to be symmetric if its components are symmetric about the diagonal, i.e. T =
TT. A skew or antisymmetric tensor has T = −TT which intuitively implies that
T11
= T22
= T33
= 0. Every second order tensor can be decomposed into symmetric
and skew parts by
T =
1
2
(T + TT)
symmetric
+
1
2
(T − TT)
skew
= symm T + skew T (1.31)
Trace The trace of a tensor T is a scalar, evaluated by summing the diagonal components
tr T = T11
+ T22
+ T33
(1.32)
Diagonal returns a vector whose components are the diagonal components of the second
rank tensor T
diag T = (T11
, T22
, T33
) (1.33)
Deviatoric and hydrostatic tensors Every second rank tensor T can be decomposed
into a deviatoric component, for which tr T = 0 and a hydrostatic component of the
form T = sI where s is a scalar. Every second rank tensor can be decomposed into
deviatoric and hydrostatic parts as follows:
T = T −
1
3
(tr T) I
deviatoric
+
1
3
(tr T) I
hydrostatic
= dev T + hyd T (1.34)
Determinant The determinant of a second rank tensor is evaluated by
det T =
T11
T12
T13
T21
T22
T23
T31
T32
T33

(T22

Cofactors The minors of a tensor are evaluated for each component by deleting the row
and column in which the component is situated and evaluating the resulting entries
as a 2 × 2 determinant. For example, the minor of T12
is
T11
T12
T13

(1.36)
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
1.4 OpenFOAM tensor classes P-21
The cofactors are signed minors where each minor is component is given a sign based
on the rule
+ve if i + j is even
−ve if i + j is odd
(1.37)
The cofactors of T can be evaluated as
cof T =

ejkr
eist

(1.38)
Inverse The inverse of a tensor can be evaluated as
inv T =

det T
(1.39)
Hodge dual of a tensor is a vector whose components are
∗ T = (T23
, −T13
, T12
) (1.40)
1.3.10 Operations exclusive to scalars
OpenFOAM supports most of the well known functions that operate on scalars, e.g. square
root, exponential, logarithm, sine, cosine etc.., a list of which can be found in Table 1.2.
There are 3 additional functions deﬁned within OpenFOAM that are described below:
Sign of a scalar s is
sgn(s) =
1 if s ≥ 0,
−1 if s < 0.
(1.41)
Positive of a scalar s is
pos(s) =
1 if s ≥ 0,
0 if s < 0.
(1.42)
Limit of a scalar s by the scalar n
limit(s, n) =
s if s < n,
0 if s ≥ n.
(1.43)
1.4 OpenFOAM tensor classes
OpenFOAM contains a C++ class library primitive that contains the classes for the tensor
mathematics described so far. The basic tensor classes that are available as standard in
OpenFOAM are listed in Table 1.1. The Table also lists the functions that allow the user
to access individual components of a tensor, known as access functions.
We can declare the tensor
T =


1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

 (1.44)
in OpenFOAM by the line:

2 Tensor tensor xx(), xy(), xz(). . .
Table 1.1: Basic tensor classes in OpenFOAM
tensor T(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
We can then access the component T13
, or Txz
using the xz() access function. For
instance the code
Info << ``Txz = '' << T.xz() << endl;
outputs to the screen:
Txz = 3
1.4.1 Algebraic tensor operations in OpenFOAM
The algebraic operations described in Section 1.3 are all available to the OpenFOAM tensor
classes using syntax which closely mimics the notation used in written mathematics. Some
functions are represented solely by descriptive functions, e.g.symm(), but others can also be
executed using symbolic operators, e.g.*. All functions are listed in Table 1.2.

1.5 Dimensional units
In continuum mechanics, properties are represented in some chosen units, e.g. mass in
kilograms (kg), volume in cubic metres (m3), pressure in Pascals (kg m s−2). Algebraic
operations must be performed on these properties using consistent units of measurement; in
particular, addition, subtraction and equality are only physically meaningful for properties of
the same dimensional units. As a safeguard against implementing a meaningless operation,
OpenFOAM encourages the user to attach dimensional units to any tensor and will then
perform dimension checking of any tensor operation.
Units are deﬁned using the dimensionSet class, e.g.
dimensionSet pressureDims(1, -1, -2, 0, 0, 0, 0);
No. Property Unit Symbol
1 Mass kilogram k
2 Length metre m
3 Time second s
4 Temperature Kelvin K
5 Quantity moles mol
6 Current ampere A
7 Luminous intensity candela cd
Table 1.3: S.I. base units of measurement
where each of the values corresponds to the power of each of the S.I. base units of mea-
surement listed in Table 1.3. The line of code declares pressureDims to be the dimensionSet
for pressure kg m s−2 since the ﬁrst entry in the pressureDims array, 1, corresponds to k1,
the second entry, -1, corresponds to m−1 etc.. A tensor with units is deﬁned using the
dimensioned<Type> template class, the <Type> being scalar, vector, tensor, etc.. The dimen-
sioned<Type> stores a variable name of class word,the value <Type> and a dimensionSet

Discretisation procedures
So far we have dealt with algebra of tensors at a point. The PDEs we wish to solve involve
derivatives of tensors with respect to time and space. We therefore need to extend our
description to a tensor ﬁeld, i.e. a tensor that varies across time and spatial domains. In
this Chapter we will ﬁrst present a mathematical description of all the diﬀerential operators
we may encounter. We will then show how a tensor ﬁeld is constructed in OpenFOAM and
how the derivatives of these ﬁelds are discretised into a set of algebraic equations.
2.1 Diﬀerential operators
Before deﬁning the spatial derivatives we ﬁrst introduce the nabla vector operator ∇, rep-
resented in index notation as ∂i
:
∇ ≡ ∂i
≡
∂
∂xi
≡
∂
∂x1
,
∂
∂x2
,
∂
∂x3
(2.1)
The nabla operator is a useful notation that obeys the following rules:
• it operates on the tensors to its right and the conventional rules of a derivative of a
product, e.g. ∂i
ab = (∂i
a) b + a (∂i
b);
• otherwise the nabla operator behaves like any other vector in an algebraic operation.
2.1.1 Gradient
If a scalar ﬁeld s is deﬁned and continuously diﬀerentiable then the gradient of s, ∇s is a
vector ﬁeld
∇s = ∂i
s =
∂s
∂x1
,
∂s
∂x2
,
∂s
∂x3
(2.2)
The gradient can operate on any tensor ﬁeld to produce a tensor ﬁeld that is one rank
higher. For example, the gradient of a vector ﬁeld a is a second rank tensor ﬁeld
∇a = ∂i
aj
=


∂a1
/∂x1
∂a2
/∂x1
∂a3
/∂x1
∂a1
/∂x2
∂a2
/∂x2
∂a3
/∂x2
∂a1
/∂x3
∂a2
/∂x3
∂a3
/∂x3

 (2.3)
P-26 Discretisation procedures
2.1.2 Divergence
If a vector ﬁeld a is deﬁned and continuously diﬀerentiable then the divergence of a is a
scalar ﬁeld
∇ •
a = ∂i
ai
=
∂a1
∂x1
+
∂a2
∂x2
+
∂a3
∂x3
(2.4)
The divergence can operate on any tensor ﬁeld of rank 1 and above to produce a tensor
that is one rank lower. For example the divergence of a second rank tensor ﬁeld T is a
vector ﬁeld (expanding the vector as a column array for convenience)
∇ •
T = ∂j
Tji
=


∂T11
/∂x1
+ ∂T21
/∂x2
+ ∂T31
/∂x3
∂T12
/∂x1
+ ∂T22
/∂x2
+ ∂T32
/∂x3
∂T13
/∂x1
+ ∂T23
/∂x2
+ ∂T33
/∂x3

 (2.5)
2.1.3 Curl
If a vector ﬁeld a is deﬁned and continuously diﬀerentiable then the curl of a, ∇ × a is a

2.1.4 Laplacian
The Laplacian is an operation that can be deﬁned mathematically by a combination of
the divergence and gradient operators by ∇2 ≡ ∇ •
∇. However, the Laplacian should be
considered as a single operation that transforms a tensor ﬁeld into another tensor ﬁeld of
the same rank, rather than a combination of two operations, one which raises the rank by
1 and one which reduces the rank by 1.
In fact, the Laplacian is best deﬁned as a scalar operator, just as we deﬁned nabla as a
vector operator, by
∇2 ≡ ∂2 ≡

2.1.5 Temporal derivative
There is more than one deﬁnition of temporal, or time, derivative of a tensor. To describe
the temporal derivatives we must ﬁrst recall that the tensor relates to a property of a volume
of material that may be moving. If we track an inﬁnitesimally small volume of material, or
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
2.2 Overview of discretisation P-27
particle, as it moves and observe the change in the tensorial property φ in time, we have
the total, or material time derivative denoted by
Dφ
Dt
= lim
∆t→0
∆φ
∆t
(2.10)
However in continuum mechanics, particularly ﬂuid mechanics, we often observe the change
of a φ in time at a ﬁxed point in space as diﬀerent particles move across that point. This
change at a point in space is termed the spatial time derivative which is denoted by ∂/∂t
and is related to the material derivative by:
Dφ
Dt
=
∂φ
∂t
+ U •
∇φ (2.11)
where U is the velocity ﬁeld of property φ. The second term on the right is known as the
convective rate of change of φ.
2.2 Overview of discretisation
The term discretisation means approximation of a problem into discrete quantities. The FV
method and others, such as the ﬁnite element and ﬁnite diﬀerence methods, all discretise
the problem as follows:
Spatial discretisation Deﬁning the solution domain by a set of points that ﬁll and bound
a region of space when connected;
Temporal discretisation (For transient problems) dividing the time domain into into a
ﬁnite number of time intervals, or steps;
Equation discretisation Generating a system of algebraic equations in terms of discrete
quantities deﬁned at speciﬁc locations in the domain, from the PDEs that characterise
the problem.
2.2.1 OpenFOAM lists and ﬁelds
OpenFOAM frequently needs to store sets of data and perform functions, such as math-
ematical operations, on the data. OpenFOAM therefore provides an array template class
List<Type>, making it possible to create a list of any object of class Type that inherits the
functions of the Type. For example a List of vector is List<vector>.
Lists of the tensor classes are deﬁned as standard in OpenFOAM by the template class
Field<Type>. For better code legibility, all instances of Field<Type>, e.g.Field<vector>, are
renamed using typedef declarations as scalarField, vectorField, tensorField, symmTensorField,
tensorThirdField and symmTensorThirdField. Algebraic operations can be performed between
Fields subject to obvious restrictions such as the ﬁelds having the same number of elements.
OpenFOAM also supports operations between a ﬁeld and single tensor, e.g. all values of a
Field U can be multiplied by the scalar 2 with the operation U = 2.0 * U.

2.3 Discretisation of the solution domain
Discretisation of the solution domain is shown in Figure 2.1. The space domain is discretised
into computational mesh on which the PDEs are subsequently discretised. Discretisation
of time, if required, is simple: it is broken into a set of time steps ∆t that may change
during a numerical simulation, perhaps depending on some condition calculated during the
simulation.

On a more detailed level, discretisation of space requires the subdivision of the domain
into a number of cells, or control volumes. The cells are contiguous, i.e. they do not overlap
one another and completely ﬁll the domain. A typical cell is shown in Figure 2.2. Dependent
variables and other properties are principally stored at the cell centroid P although they
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
2.3 Discretisation of the solution domain P-29
may be stored on faces or vertices. The cell is bounded by a set of ﬂat faces, given the
generic label f. In OpenFOAM there is no limitation on the number of faces bounding
each cell, nor any restriction on the alignment of each face. This kind of mesh is often
referred to as “arbitrarily unstructured” to diﬀerentiate it from meshes in which the cell
faces have a prescribed alignment, typically with the coordinate axes. Codes with arbitrarily
unstructured meshes oﬀer greater freedom in mesh generation and manipulation in particular
when the geometry of the domain is complex or changes over time.
Whilst most properties are deﬁned at the cell centroids, some are deﬁned at cell faces.
There are two types of cell face.
Internal faces Those faces that connect two cells (and it can never be more than two).
For each internal face, OpenFOAM designates one adjoining cell to be the face owner
and the other to be the neighbour;
Boundary faces Those belonging to one cell since they coincide with the boundary of the
domain. These faces simply have an owner cell.
2.3.1 Deﬁning a mesh in OpenFOAM
There are diﬀerent levels of mesh description in OpenFOAM, beginning with the most basic
mesh class, named polyMesh since it is based on polyhedra. A polyMesh is constructed
using the minimum information required to deﬁne the mesh geometry described below and
presented in Figure 2.3:
Points A list of cell vertex point coordinate vectors, i.e. a vectorField, that is renamed
pointField using a typedef declaration;
Faces A list of cell faces List<face>, or faceList, where the face class is deﬁned by a list of
vertex numbers, corresponding to the pointField;
Cells a list of cells List<cell>, or cellList, where the cell class is deﬁned by a list of face
numbers, corresponding to the faceList described previously.
Boundary a polyBoundaryMesh decomposed into a list of patches, polyPatchList represent-
ing diﬀerent regions of the boundary. The boundary is subdivided in this manner
to allow diﬀerent boundary conditions to be speciﬁed on diﬀerent patches during a
solution. All the faces of any polyPatch are stored as a single block of the faceList, so
that its faces can be easily accessed using the slice class which stores references to the
ﬁrst and last face of the block. Each polyPatch is then constructed from
• a slice;
• a word to assign it a name.
FV discretisation uses speciﬁc data that is derived from the mesh geometry stored in
polyMesh. OpenFOAM therefore extends the polyMesh class to fvMesh which stores the
additional data needed for FV discretisation. fvMesh is constructed from polyMesh and
stores the data in Table 2.1 which can be updated during runtime in cases where the mesh
moves, is reﬁned etc..

2.3.2 Deﬁning a geometricField in OpenFOAM
So far we can deﬁne a ﬁeld, i.e. a list of tensors, and a mesh. These can be combined to
deﬁne a tensor ﬁeld relating to discrete points in our domain, speciﬁed in OpenFOAM by
the template class geometricField<Type>. The Field values are separated into those deﬁned
within the internal region of the domain, e.g. at the cell centres, and those deﬁned on
the domain boundary, e.g. on the boundary faces. The geometricField<Type> stores the
following information:
Internal ﬁeld This is simply a Field<Type>, described in Section 2.2.1;
BoundaryField This is a GeometricBoundaryField, in which a Field is deﬁned for the faces
of each patch and a Field is deﬁned for the patches of the boundary. This is then a
ﬁeld of ﬁelds, stored within an object of the FieldField<Type> class. A reference to the
fvBoundaryMesh is also stored [**].
Mesh A reference to an fvMesh, with some additional detail as to the whether the ﬁeld is
deﬁned at cell centres, faces, etc..
Dimensions A dimensionSet, described in Section 4.2.6.
Old values Discretisation of time derivatives requires ﬁeld data from previous time steps.

Table 2.1: fvMesh stored data.
The geometricField<Type> will store references to stored ﬁelds from the previous, or
old, time step and its previous, or old-old, time step where necessary.
Previous iteration values The iterative solution procedures can use under-relaxation
which requires access to data from the previous iteration. Again, if required, geo-
metricField<Type> stores a reference to the data from the previous iteration.
As discussed in Section 2.3, we principally deﬁne a property at the cell centres but quite
often it is stored at the cell faces and on occasion it is deﬁned on cell vertices. The geomet-
ricField<Type> is renamed using typedef declarations to indicate where the ﬁeld variable is
deﬁned as follows:
volField<Type> A ﬁeld deﬁned at cell centres;
surfaceField<Type> A ﬁeld deﬁned on cell faces;
pointField<Type> A ﬁeld deﬁned on cell vertices.
These typedef ﬁeld classes of geometricField<Type>are illustrated in Figure 2.4. A
geometricField<Type> inherits all the tensor algebra of Field<Type> and has all operations
subjected to dimension checking using the dimensionSet. It can also be subjected to the
FV discretisation procedures described in the following Section. The class structure used to
build geometricField<Type> is shown in Figure 2.51.
2.4 Equation discretisation
Equation discretisation converts the PDEs into a set of algebraic equations that are com-
monly expressed in matrix form as:
[A] [x] = [b] (2.12)
where [A] is a square matrix, [x] is the column vector of dependent variable and [b] is the
source vector. The description of [x] and [b] as ‘vectors’ comes from matrix terminology
rather than being a precise description of what they truly are: a list of values deﬁned at
locations in the geometry, i.e. a geometricField<Type>, or more speciﬁcally a volField<Type>
when using FV discretisation.
1The diagram is not an exact description of the class hierarchy, rather a representation of the general
structure leading from some primitive classes to geometric<Type>Field.

[A] is a list of coeﬃcients of a set of algebraic equations, and cannot be described as a
geometricField<Type>. It is therefore given a class of its own: fvMatrix. fvMatrix<Type> is
created through discretisation of a geometric<Type>Field and therefore inherits the <Type>.
It supports many of the standard algebraic matrix operations of addition +, subtraction -
and multiplication *.
Each term in a PDE is represented individually in OpenFOAM code using the classes
of static functions ﬁniteVolumeMethod and ﬁniteVolumeCalculus, abbreviated by a typedef
to fvm and fvc respectively. fvm and fvc contain static functions, representing diﬀerential
operators, e.g. ∇2, ∇ •
and ∂/∂t, that discretise geometricField<Type>s. The purpose of
deﬁning these functions within two classes, fvm and fvc, rather than one, is to distinguish:
• functions of fvm that calculate implicit derivatives of and return an fvMatrix<Type>
• some functions of fvc that calculate explicit derivatives and other explicit calculations,
returning a geometricField<Type>.
Figure 2.6 shows a geometricField<Type> deﬁned on a mesh with 2 boundary patches and
illustrates the explicit operations merely transform one ﬁeld to another and drawn in 2D
for simplicity.

derivatives: divergence ∇ •
φ, gradient ∇φ and ∇ × φ. Volume and surface integrals are
then linearised using appropriate schemes which are described for each term in the following
Sections. Some terms are always discretised using one scheme, a selection of schemes is
oﬀered in OpenFOAM for the discretisation of other terms. The choice of scheme is either
made by a direct speciﬁcation within the code or it can be read from an input ﬁle at job
run-time and stored within an fvSchemes class object.

cell centre values.

(2.17)
where fx
≡ fN/PN where fN is the distance between f and cell centre N and PN

from the direction of ﬂow and is bounded at
the expense of accuracy

The term is discretised by simple diﬀerencing in time using:
new values φn ≡ φ(t + ∆t) at the time step we are solving for;

old-old values φoo ≡ φ(t − ∆t) stored from a time step previous to the last.
One of two discretisation schemes can be declared using the timeScheme keyword in the
appropriate input ﬁle, described in detail in section 4.4 of the User Guide.

2.4.5 Divergence
The divergence term described in this Section is strictly an explicit term that is distinguished
from the convection term of Section 2.4.2, i.e. in that it is not the divergence of the product
of a velocity and dependent variable. The term is integrated over a control volume and
linearised as follows:

(2.24)
The fvc::div function can take as its argument either a surface<Type>Field, in which case
φf
is speciﬁed directly, or a vol<Type>Field which is interpolated to the face by central
diﬀerencing as described in Section 2.4.10:
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
P-38 Discretisation procedures
2.4.6 Gradient
The gradient term is an explicit term that can be evaluated in a variety of ways. The scheme
can be evaluated either by selecting the particular grad function relevant to the discretisation
scheme, e.g.fvc::gGrad, fvc::lsGrad etc., or by using the fvc::grad function combined
with the appropriate gradScheme keyword in an input ﬁle
Gauss integration is invoked using the fvc::grad function with gradScheme Gauss or
directly using the fvc::gGrad function. The discretisation is performed using the
standard method of applying Gauss’s theorem to the volume integral:
V
∇φ dV =
S
dS φ =
f
Sf
φf
(2.25)
As with the fvc::div function, the Gaussian integration fvc::grad function can take
either a surfaceField<Type> or a volField<Type> as an argument.
Least squares method is based on the following idea:
1. a value at point P can be extrapolated to neighbouring point N using the gradient
at P;
2. the extrapolated value at N can be compared to the actual value at N, the
diﬀerence being the error;
3. if we now minimise the sum of the square of weighted errors at all neighbours of
P with the respect to the gradient, then the gradient should be a good approxi-
mation.
Least squares is invoked using the fvc::grad function with timeScheme leastSquares
or directly using the fvc::lsGrad function. The discretisation is performed as by ﬁrst
calculating the tensor G at every point P by summing over neighbours N:
G =
N
w2
N
dd (2.26)
where d is the vector from P to N and the weighting function wN
= 1/|d|. The
gradient is then evaluated as:
(∇φ)
P
=
N
w2
N
G−1
•
d (φN
− φP
) (2.27)
Surface normal gradient The gradient normal to a surface nf •
(∇φ)
f
can be evaluated
at cell faces using the scheme
(∇φ)
f
=
φN
− φP
|d|
(2.28)
This gradient is called by the function fvc::snGrad and returns a surfaceField<Type>.
The scheme is directly analogous to that evaluated for the Laplacian discretisation
scheme in Section 2.4.1, and in the same manner, a correction can be introduced to
improve the accuracy of this face gradient in the case of non-orthogonal meshes. This
correction is called using the function fvc::snGradCorrection.
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
2.4 Equation discretisation P-39
2.4.7 Grad-grad squared
The grad-grad squared term is evaluated by: taking the gradient of the ﬁeld; taking the
gradient of the resulting gradient ﬁeld; and then calculating the magnitude squared of the
result. The mathematical expression for grad-grad squared of φ is |∇ (∇φ)|2.
2.4.8 Curl
The curl is evaluated from the gradient term described in Section 2.4.6. First, the gradient is
discretised and then the curl is evaluated using the relationship from Equation 2.7, repeated
here for convenience
∇ × φ = 2 ∗(skew ∇φ)
2.4.9 Source terms
Source terms can be speciﬁed in 3 ways
Explicit Every explicit term is a volField<Type>. Hence, an explicit source term can be
incorporated into an equation simply as a ﬁeld of values. For example if we wished
to solve Poisson’s equation ∇2φ = f, we would deﬁne phi and f as volScalarField and
then do
solve(fvm::laplacian(phi) == f)
Implicit An implicit source term is integrated over a control volume and linearised by
V
ρφ dV = ρP
VP
φP
(2.29)
Implicit/Explicit The implicit source term changes the coeﬃcient of the diagonal of the
matrix. Depending on the sign of the coeﬃcient and matrix terms, this will either
increase or decrease diagonal dominance of the matrix. Decreasing the diagonal dom-
inance could cause instability during iterative solution of the matrix equation. There-
fore OpenFOAM provides a mixed source discretisation procedure that is implicit
when the coeﬃcients that are greater than zero, and explicit for the coeﬃcients less
than zero. In mathematical terms the matrix coeﬃcient for node P is VP
max(ρP
, 0)
and the source term is VP
φP
min(ρP
, 0).
2.4.10 Other explicit discretisation schemes
There are some other discretisation procedures that convert volField<Type>s into surface<Type>Fields
and visa versa.
Surface integral fvc::surfaceIntegrate performs a summation of surface<Type>Field
face values bounding each cell and dividing by the cell volume, i.e. (
f
φf
)/VP
. It
returns a volField<Type>.
Surface sum fvc::surfaceSum performs a summation of surface<Type>Field face values
bounding each cell, i.e.
f
φf
returning a volField<Type>.
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1

ues, i.e. (

Reconstruct
Face interpolate The geometric<Type>Field function faceInterpolate() interpolates volField<Type
cell centre values to cell faces using central diﬀerencing, returning a surface<Type>Field.
2.5 Temporal discretisation
Although we have described the discretisation of temporal derivatives in Sections 2.4.3 and
2.4.4, we need to consider how to treat the spatial derivatives in a transient problem. If we
denote all the spatial terms as Aφ where A is any spatial operator, e.g. Laplacian, then we
can express a transient PDE in integral form as
t+∆t
t
∂
∂t V
ρφ dV +
V
Aφ dV dt = 0 (2.30)
Using the Euler implicit method of Equation 2.21, the ﬁrst term can be expressed as
t+∆t

ρφ dV dt =
t+∆t

(2.31)
The second term can be expressed as
t+∆t
t V
Aφ dV dt =
t+∆t
t
A∗φ dt (2.32)
where A∗ represents the spatial discretisation of A. The time integral can be discretised in
three ways:
Euler implicit uses implicit discretisation of the spatial terms, thereby taking current
values φn.
t+∆t
t
A∗φ dt = A∗φn∆t (2.33)
It is ﬁrst order accurate in time, guarantees boundedness and is unconditionally stable.
Explicit uses explicit discretisation of the spatial terms, thereby taking old values φo.
t+∆t
t
A∗φ dt = A∗φo∆t (2.34)
It is ﬁrst order accurate in time and is unstable if the Courant number Co is greater
than 1. The Courant number is deﬁned as
Co =
Uf •
d
|d|2∆t
(2.35)
where Uf
is a characteristic velocity, e.g. velocity of a wave front, velocity of ﬂow.

Crank Nicolson uses the trapezoid rule to discretise the spatial terms, thereby taking a
mean of current values φn and old values φo.

∆t (2.36)
It is second order accurate in time, is unconditionally stable but does not guarantee
boundedness.
2.5.1 Treatment of temporal discretisation in OpenFOAM
At present the treatment of the temporal discretisation is controlled by the implementation
of the spatial derivatives in the PDE we wish to solve. For example, let us say we wish to
solve a transient diﬀusion equation
∂φ
∂t
= κ∇2φ (2.37)
An Euler implicit implementation of this would read
solve(fvm::ddt(phi) == kappa*fvm::laplacian(phi))
where we use the fvm class to discretise the Laplacian term implicitly. An explicit imple-
mentation would read
solve(fvm::ddt(phi) == kappa*fvc::laplacian(phi))
where we now use the fvc class to discretise the Laplacian term explicitly. The Crank
Nicolson scheme can be implemented by the mean of implicit and explicit terms:
solve
(
fvm::ddt(phi)
==
kappa*0.5*(fvm::laplacian(phi) + fvc::laplacian(phi))
)
2.6 Boundary Conditions
Boundary conditions are required to complete the problem we wish to solve. We therefore
need to specify boundary conditions on all our boundary faces. Boundary conditions can
be divided into 2 types:
Dirichlet prescribes the value of the dependent variable on the boundary and is therefore
termed ‘ﬁxed value’ in this guide;
Neumann prescribes the gradient of the variable normal to the boundary and is therefore
termed ‘ﬁxed gradient’ in this guide.
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
P-42 Discretisation procedures
When we perform discretisation of terms that include the sum over faces
f
, we need
to consider what happens when one of the faces is a boundary face.
Fixed value We specify a ﬁxed value at the boundary φb
• We can simply substitute φb
in cases where the discretisation requires the value
on a boundary face φf
, e.g. in the convection term in Equation 2.16.
• In terms where the face gradient (∇φ)
f
is required, e.g. Laplacian, it is calculated
using the boundary face value and cell centre value,
Sf •
(∇φ)f
= |Sf
|
φb
− φP
|d|
(2.38)
Fixed gradient The ﬁxed gradient boundary condition gb
is a speciﬁcation on inner prod-
uct of the gradient and unit normal to the boundary, or
gb
=
S
|S| •
∇φ
f
(2.39)
• When discretisation requires the value on a boundary face φf
we must interpolate
the cell centre value to the boundary by
φf
= φP
+ d •
(∇φ)f
= φP
+ |d| gb
(2.40)
• φb
can be directly substituted in cases where the discretisation requires the face
gradient to be evaluated,

(2.41)
2.6.1 Physical boundary conditions
The speciﬁcation of boundary conditions is usually an engineer’s interpretation of the true
behaviour. Real boundary conditions are generally deﬁned by some physical attributes
rather than the numerical description as described of the previous Section. In incompressible
ﬂuid ﬂow there are the following physical boundaries
Inlet The velocity ﬁeld at the inlet is supplied and, for consistency, the boundary condition
on pressure is zero gradient.
Outlet The pressure ﬁeld at the outlet is supplied and a zero gradient boundary condition
on velocity is speciﬁed.
No-slip impermeable wall The velocity of the ﬂuid is equal to that of the wall itself, i.e.
a ﬁxed value condition can be speciﬁed. The pressure is speciﬁed zero gradient since
the ﬂux through the wall is zero.
In a problem whose solution domain and boundary conditions are symmetric about a
plane, we only need to model half the domain to one side of the symmetry plane. The
boundary condition on the plane must be speciﬁed according to
Symmetry plane The symmetry plane condition speciﬁes the component of the gradient
normal to the plane should be zero.

Chapter 3
Examples of the use of OpenFOAM
In this section we shall describe several test cases supplied with the OpenFOAM distribu-
tion. The intention is to provide example cases, including those in the tutorials in chapter 2
of the User Guide, for every standard solver. The examples are designed to introduce cer-
tain tools and features of OpenFOAM, e.g. within pre-/post-processing, numerical schemes,
algorithms. They also provide a means for validation of solvers although that is not their
principal function.
Each example contains a description of the problem: the geometry, initial and boundary
conditions, a brief description of the equations being solved, models used, and physical
properties required. The solution domain is selected which may be a portion of the original
geometry, e.g. if we introduce symmetry planes. The method of meshing, usually blockMesh,
is speciﬁed; of course the user can simply view the mesh since every example is distributed
with the polyMesh directory containing the data ﬁles that describe the mesh.
The examples coexist with the tutorials in the tutorials subdirectory of the OpenFOAM
installation. They are organised into a set of subdirectories by solver, e.g. all the icoFoam
cases are stored within a subdirectory icoFoam. Before running a particular example, the
user is urged to copy it into their user account. We recommend that the user stores all
OpenFOAM cases in a directory we recommend that the tutorials are copied into a directory
$FOAM RUN. If this directory structure has not yet been created in the user’s account, it
can be created with
mkdir -p $FOAM RUN
The tutorials can then be copied into this directory with
cp -r $FOAM TUTORIALS/* $FOAM RUN
3.1 Flow around a cylinder
In this example we shall investigate potential ﬂow around a cylinder using potentialFoam.
This example introduces the following OpenFOAM features:
• non-orthogonal meshes;
• generating an analytical solution to a problem in OpenFOAM.
P-44 Examples of the use of OpenFOAM
3.1.1 Problem speciﬁcation
The problem is deﬁned as follows:
Solution domain The domain is 2 dimensional and consists of a square domain with a
cylinder collocated with the centre of the square as shown in Figure 3.1.

∇ •

• Pressure equation for an incompressible, irrotational ﬂuid assuming steady-state
conditions
∇2p = 0 (3.2)
Boundary conditions
• Inlet (left) with ﬁxed velocity U = (1, 0, 0) m/s.
• Outlet (right) with a ﬁxed pressure p = 0 Pa.
• No-slip wall (bottom);
• Symmetry plane (top).
Initial conditions U = 0 m/s, p = 0 Pa — required in OpenFOAM input ﬁles but not
necessary for the solution since the problem is steady-state.
Solver name potentialFoam: a potential ﬂow code, i.e. assumes the ﬂow is incompressible,
steady, irrotational, inviscid and it ignores gravity.
Case name cylinder case located in the $FOAM TUTORIALS/potentialFoam directory.
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
3.1 Flow around a cylinder P-45
3.1.2 Note on potentialFoam
potentialFoam is a useful solver to validate OpenFOAM since the assumptions of potential
ﬂow are such that an analytical solution exists for cases whose geometries are relatively
simple. In this example of ﬂow around a cylinder an analytical solution exists with which
we can compare our numerical solution. potentialFoam can also be run more like a utility
to provide a (reasonably) conservative initial U ﬁeld for a problem. When running certain
cases, this can useful for avoiding instabilities due to the initial ﬁeld being unstable. In short,
potentialFoam creates a conservative ﬁeld from a non-conservative initial ﬁeld supplied by
the user.
3.1.3 Mesh generation
Mesh generation using blockMesh has been described in tutorials in the User Guide. In this
case, the mesh consists of 10 blocks as shown in Figure 3.2. Remember that all meshes

we must describe a 3 dimensional mesh that is only one cell thick in the third direction
that is not solved. In Figure 3.2 we show only the back plane of the geometry, along
z = −0.5, in which the vertex numbers are numbered 0-18. The other 19 vertices in the
front plane, z = +0.5, are numbered in the same order as the back plane, as shown in the

3.1.4 Boundary conditions and initial ﬁelds
Using FoamX or editing case ﬁles by hand, set the boundary conditions in accordance with
the problem description in Figure 3.1, i.e. the left boundary should be an Inlet, the right
Open∇FOAM-2.3.1
P-48 Examples of the use of OpenFOAM
boundary should be an Outlet and the down and cylinder boundaries should be symme-
tryPlane. The top boundary conditions is chosen so that we can make the most genuine
comparison with our analytical solution which uses the assumption that the domain is inﬁ-
nite in the y direction. The result is that the normal gradient of U is small along a plane
coinciding with our boundary. We therefore impose the condition that the normal com-
ponent is zero, i.e. specify the boundary as a symmetryPlane, thereby ensuring that the
comparison with the analytical is reasonable.
3.1.5 Running the case
No ﬂuid properties need be speciﬁed in this problem since the ﬂow is assumed to be in-
compressible and inviscid. In the system subdirectory, the controlDict speciﬁes the control
parameters for the run. Note that since we assume steady ﬂow, we only run for 1 time step:

potentialFoam executes an iterative loop around the pressure equation which it solves in
order that explicit terms relating to non-orthogonal correction in the Laplacian term may
be updated in successive iterations. The number of iterations around the pressure equation is
controlled by the nNonOrthogonalCorrectors keyword in controlDict. In the ﬁrst instance
we can set nNonOrthogonalCorrectors to 0 so that no loops are performed, i.e. the pressure
equation is solved once, and there is no non-orthogonal correction. The solution is shown
in Figure 3.3(a) (at t = 1, when the steady-state simulation is complete). We expect
the solution to show smooth streamlines passing across the domain as in the analytical
solution in Figure 3.3(c), yet there is clearly some error in the regions where there is high
non-orthogonality in the mesh, e.g. at the join of blocks 0, 1 and 3. The case can be run a
second time with some non-orthogonal correction by setting nNonOrthogonalCorrectors to
3. The solution shows smooth streamlines with no signiﬁcant error due to non-orthogonality
as shown in Figure 3.3(b).
3.2 Steady turbulent ﬂow over a backward-facing step
In this example we shall investigate steady turbulent ﬂow over a backward-facing step.
The problem description is taken from one used by Pitz and Daily in an experimental
investigation [**] against which the computed solution can be compared. This example
introduces the following OpenFOAM features for the ﬁrst time:
• generation of a mesh using blockMesh using full mesh grading capability;
• steady turbulent ﬂow.
3.2.1 Problem speciﬁcation
The problem is deﬁned as follows:
Solution domain The domain is 2 dimensional, consisting of a short inlet, a backward-
facing step and converging nozzle at outlet as shown in Figure 3.4.

models in the incompressibleTurbulenceModels library and the non-Newtonian models incom-
pressibleTransportModels library of the standard OpenFOAM release.
3.2.2 Mesh generation
We expect that the ﬂow in this problem is reasonably complex and an optimum solution will
require grading of the mesh. In general, the regions of highest shear are particularly critical,
requiring a ﬁner mesh than in the regions of low shear. We can anticipate where high shear
will occur by considering what the solution might be in advance of any calculation. At
the inlet we have strong uniform ﬂow in the x direction and, as it passes over the step, it
generates shear on the ﬂuid below, generating a vortex in the bottom half of the domain.
The regions of high shear will therefore be close to the centreline of the domain and close
to the walls.
The domain is subdivided into 12 blocks as shown in Figure 3.5.
The mesh is 3 dimensional, as always in OpenFOAM, so in Figure 3.5 we are viewing
the back plane along z = −0.5. The full set of vertices and blocks are given in the mesh

A major feature of this problem is the use of the full mesh grading capability of blockMesh
that is described in section 5.3.1 of the User Guide. The user can see that blocks 4,5 and 6
use the full list of 12 expansion ratios. The expansion ratios correspond to each edge of the
block, the ﬁrst 4 to the edges aligned in the local x1
direction, the second 4 to the edges
in the local x2
direction and the last 4 to the edges in the local x3
direction. In blocks 4,
5, and 6, the ratios are equal for all edges in the local x1
and x3
directions but not for the
edges in the x2
direction that corresponds in all blocks to the global y. If we consider the
ratios used in relation to the block deﬁnition in section 5.3.1 of the User Guide, we realize
that diﬀerent gradings have been prescribed along the left and right edges in blocks 4,5 and
6 in Figure 3.5. The purpose of this diﬀerential grading is to generate a ﬁne mesh close to
the most critical region of ﬂow, the corner of the step, and allow it to expand into the rest
of the domain.
The mesh can be generated using blockMesh from the command line or from within
FoamX and viewed as described in previous examples.
3.2.3 Boundary conditions and initial ﬁelds
The case ﬁles can be viewed, or edited from within FoamX or by hand. In this case, we are
required to set the initial and boundary ﬁelds for velocity U, pressure p, turbulent kinetic
energy k and dissipation rate ε. The boundary conditions can be speciﬁed by setting the
physical patch types in FoamX: the upper and lower walls are set to Wall, the left patch
to Inlet and the right patch to Outlet. These physical boundary conditions require us to
specify a ﬁxedValue at the inlet on U, k and ε. U is given in the problem speciﬁcation,
but the values of k and ǫ must be chosen by the user in a similar manner to that described
in section 2.1.8.1 of the User Guide. We assume that the inlet turbulence is isotropic and
estimate the ﬂuctuations to be 5% of U at the inlet. We have

0.1 × 25.4 × 10−3

At the outlet we need only specify the pressure p = 0Pa.
3.2.4 Case control
The choices of fvSchemes are as follows: the timeScheme should be SteadyState; the
gradScheme and laplacianScheme should be set as default to Gauss; and, the divScheme
should be set to UD to ensure boundedness.
Special attention should be paid to the settings of fvTolerances. Although the top level
simpleFoam code contains only equations for p and U, the turbulent model solves equations
for k, ε and R, and tolerance settings are required for all 5 equations. A solverTolerance
of 10−5 and solverRelativeTolerance of 0.1 are acceptable for all variables with the
exception of p when 10−6 and 0.01 are recommended. Under-relaxation of the solution is
required since the problem is steady. A relaxationFactor of 0.7 is acceptable for U, k, ε
and R but 0.3 is required for p to avoid numerical instability.
Finally, in controlDict, the time step deltaT should be set to 1 since in steady state
cases such as this is eﬀectively an iteration counter. With beneﬁt of hindsight we know that
the solution requires 1000 iterations reach reasonable convergence, hence endTime is set to
1000. Ensure that the writeFrequency is suﬃciently high, e.g. 50, that you will not ﬁll the
hard disk with data during run time.

P-58 Examples of the use of OpenFOAM
Run the case and post-process the results. After a few iterations, e.g. 50, a vortex
develops beneath the corner of the step that is the height of the step but narrow in the
x-direction as shown by the vector plot of velocities is shown Figure 3.6(a). Over several
iterations the vortex stretches in the x-direction from the step to the outlet until at 1000
iterations the system reaches a steady-state in which the vortex is fully developed as shown
in Figure 3.6(b-c).
3.3 Supersonic ﬂow over a forward-facing step
In this example we shall investigate supersonic ﬂow over a forward-facing step. The problem
description involves a ﬂow of Mach 3 at an inlet to a rectangular geometry with a step near
the inlet region that generates shock waves.
This example introduces the following OpenFOAM features for the ﬁrst time:
• supersonic ﬂow;

inar gas ﬂow.
The case is designed such that the speed of sound of the gas c =
√
γRT = 1 m/s, the
consequence being that the velocities are directly equivalent to the Mach number, e.g. the
inlet velocity of 3 m/s is equivalent to Mach 3. This speed of sound calculation can be
veriﬁed using the relationship for a perfect gas, Cp
− Cv = R, i.e. the ratio of speciﬁc heats
γ = Cp

3.3.2 Mesh generation
The mesh used in this case is relatively simple, speciﬁed with uniform rectangular cells of
length 0.06 m in the x direction and 0.05 m in the y direction. The geometry can simply
be divided into 3 blocks, one below the top of the step, and two above the step, one either
side of the step front. The full set of vertices and blocks are given in the mesh description

In this example we shall investigate a problem of rapid opening of a pipe valve close to
a pressurised liquid-ﬁlled tank. The prominent feature of the result in such cases is the
propagation of pressure waves which must therefore be modelled as a compressible liquid.

3.4 Decompression of a tank internally pressurised with water P-65
In order to improve the numerical accuracy, we shall use the reference level of 1 bar for the
pressure ﬁeld. Note that both the internal ﬁeld level and the boundary conditions are oﬀset
by the reference level.
3.4.3 Preparing the Run
Before we commence the setup of the calculation, we need to consider the characteristic
velocity of the phenomenon we are trying to capture. In the case under consideration, the
ﬂuid velocity will be very small, but the pressure wave will propagate with the speed of
sound in water. The speed of sound is calculated as:
c =
1
ψ
=
1
4.54 × 10−7
= 1483.2m/s. (3.17)
For the mesh described above, the characteristic mesh size is approximately 2 mm (note the
scaling factor of 0.1 in the blockMeshDict ﬁle). Using
Co =
U ∆t
∆x
(3.18)
a reasonable time step is around ∆t = 5 × 10−7s, giving the Co number of 0.35, based on
the speed of sound. Also, note that the reported Co number by the code (associated with
the convective velocity) will be two orders of magnitude smaller. As we are interested in
the pressure wave propagation, we shall set the simulation time to 0.25 ms. For reference,
the controlDict ﬁle is quoted below.

Figure 3.10: Propagation of pressure waves
The user can run the case and view results in dxFoam. The liquid ﬂows out through
the nozzle causing a wave to move along the nozzle. As it reaches the inlet to the tank,
some of the wave is transmitted into the tank and some of it is reﬂected. While a wave
is reﬂected up and down the inlet pipe, the waves transmitted into the tank expand and
propagate through the tank. In Figure 3.10, the pressures are shown as contours so that
the wave fronts are more clearly deﬁned than if plotted as a normal isoline plot.
If the simulation is run for a long enough time for the reﬂected wave to return to the
pipe, we can see that negative absolute pressure is detected. The modelling permits this and
has some physical basis since liquids can support tension, i.e. negative pressures. In reality,
however, impurities or dissolved gases in liquids act as sites for cavitation, or vapourisa-
tion/boiling, of the liquid due to the low pressure. Therefore in practical situations, we
generally do not observe pressures falling below the vapourisation pressure of the liquid; not
at least for longer than it takes for the cavitation process to occur.

3.4.5 Improving the solution by reﬁning the mesh
Looking at the evolution of the resulting pressure ﬁeld in time, we can clearly see the
propagation of the pressure wave into the tank and numerous reﬂections from the inside
walls. It is also obvious that the pressure wave is smeared over a number of cells. We shall
now reﬁne the mesh and reduce the time step to obtain a sharper front resolution. Simply
edit the blockMeshDict and increase the number of cells by a factor of 4 in the x and y
directions, i.e. block 0 becomes (120 80 1) from (30 20 1) and so on. Run blockMesh on
this ﬁle. In addition, in order to maintain a Courant number below 1, the time step must
be reduced accordingly to ∆t = 10−7 s. The second simulation gives considerably better
resolution of the pressure waves as shown in Figure 3.11.
3.5 Magnetohydrodynamic ﬂow of a liquid
In this example we shall investigate an ﬂow of an electrically-conducting liquid through a
magnetic ﬁeld. The problem is one belonging to the branch of ﬂuid dynamics known as
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that uses mhdFoam.
3.5.1 Problem speciﬁcation
The problem is known as the Hartmann problem, chosen as it contains an analytical solution
with which mhdFoam can be validated. It is deﬁned as follows:
Solution domain The domain is 2 dimensional and consists of ﬂow along two parallel
plates as shown in Fig. 3.12.

3.5.3 Running the case
The user can run the case and view results in dxFoam. It is also useful at this stage to run
the Ucomponents utility to convert the U vector ﬁeld into individual scalar components.
MHD ﬂow is governed by, amongst other things, the Hartmann number which is a measure
of the ratio of electromagnetic body force to viscous force
M = BL
σ
ρν
(3.28)
where L is the characteristic length scale. In this case with By
= 20 T, M = 20 and the
electromagnetic body forces dominate the viscous forces. Consequently with the ﬂow fairly
steady at t = 2 s the velocity proﬁle is almost planar, viewed at a cross section midway
along the domain x = 10 m. The user can plot a graph of the proﬁle of Ux
in dxFoam.
Now the user should reduce the magnetic ﬂux density B to 1 Tand re-run the code and
Ucomponents. In this case, M = 1 and the electromagnetic body forces no longer dominate.
